##Gradle Scratch Space
[Gradle in Action](http://www.manning.com/muschko/)

###Notes
* Eclipse cannot find references (F3) for Gradle build files
* Intellij can find references (F3) but needs some help the respective Gradle and Groovy sources have to provided
    * It also interesting to note the the size of the library doesn't seem to affect the performance of Intellij, as in exclusively adding in the Gradle core located in gradle/src/core or the Groovy core located in groovy/src/src/main vs adding in the root folder (gradle/groovy) or the src folder (gradle/src or groovy/src), Intellij simply scans and finds the sources
    
####TODO
* Push IDEA and Eclipse settings
